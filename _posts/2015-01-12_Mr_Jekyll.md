##Mr. Jekyll shows his face

After a weekend of setting up a GitHub account, installing things via command line, and downloading some extra stuff that I still don't know much about, this record of my attempted projects is finally ready to get off the ground. I wouldn't have made it even this far without the help of the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. It helped quite a bit.

Next up, get familiar with the basics of Git and Markdown, and record my progress. Until next weekend.
