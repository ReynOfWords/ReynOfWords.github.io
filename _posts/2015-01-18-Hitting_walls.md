title: Hitting invisible walls
---

Unfortunately for me, the easiest way to find invisible walls is to run into them face first. This last week I hit two of them.

The first wall took me the entire week to realize I had actually hit it. When I found myself Sunday night sitting at the computer with little new to show for the week I realized the first hurdle to overcome would simply be making sure that I took the time to put in the work. It's an easy thing to tell myself that I have a whole weekend to spend online looking at tutorials and trying new things. It turns out that spending large chunks of time on one project, especially one I'm not very good at, is extremely difficult.

Luckily, I think, the trick to getting around this wall is realizing that it's even there. Then, I can try to plan around them accordingly. In this case, I'll have to work at blocking out smaller chunks of time throughout the week, instead of relying on one marathon session on the weekend. As long as I keep them relatively short, maybe 15 to 30 minutes, and focus on relatively small problems, it should be easier to make and track my progress.

By spreading out my time throughout the week, I should be able to reduce the impact of another wall. Throughout the weekend, I had problems with wrist pain while typing, and on Sunday with a migraine headache that prevented me from spending much time looking at a computer screen. By spreading out my study time through the week instead of trying to do it all at once I hope to minimize the stress on my wrists and reduce the impact of other health-related or just unforeseeable problems that may keep me from concentrating for extended lengths of time.

This is not to say, however, that my week was entirely unproductive. I spent a bit more time using Git in the terminal. The most important thing I learned is to be aware of what directory I am running get from. If you do ```Git add *``` from within the project directory it will add your project files. If you do that same thing from, say, your user directory (because you put your project directory within it), you end up committing your entire user directory.

Or at least, I did. Beware the siren call of ```*```.

Thankfully, Git is made to deal with mistakes, and despite some panicking at a lot of red text, I managed to reset the files that Git was tracking for this project. After brushing up on my terminal commands for specifying paths, I was able to manually add, commit, and push up a new file, while making Git ignore the template file that I had created for making future posts.

And while I might be making another mistake, I've added another piece of software to my learning list. I decided to purchase the home version of Dragon Naturally Speaking in an attempt to reduce the total typing I do. Learning so many new things at once may prove to be an issue, but it hasn't been too difficult as I dictate this post, and Markdown is an easy thing to add after writing the copy, so I think it will be worth it. I'll continue to work on my typing skills in order to make coding faster, since I don't think Dragon will lend itself well to all the extra punctuation that most programming languages require. But every keystroke saved helps.

For the next week, I'm setting myself the project of laying out some more concrete steps toward my programming goals, including making the very general goal of "learning to program" a set of much more specific goals. This is something I know I'm pretty bad at, so we'll see how far I get.
