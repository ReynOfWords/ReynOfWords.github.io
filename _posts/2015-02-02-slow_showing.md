###The good news:

I spent more time this week on practicing my programming (and related) skills than any other week so far. 

*Yay, improvement!*

###The bad news:

Almost none of the time I spent will be observable in this post. 

You mught notice the new avatar image, drawn especially for me by the infamous artist, myself.

I *have* been spending time on impoving my typing speed and accuracy (though a long way to go on both fronts there), [refreshing myself on HTML and CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org) (since I haven't worked with either since HTML4 and CSS2 were brand new), and acqainting myself with the [current EPUB standard](http://idpf.org/epub).

Not a total loss, certainly. Though [APEX 2015](http://apex-series.com) threatened to suck away all my attention this weekend. Which it did. Mostly. Yay for east coast tournament streams ending at reasonable times for me.

Until next week!
