####The steps behind

  This is the first blog post where I feel unsure what to start with. I spent the majority of my study time working through the HTML/CSS course on Khan Academy. It was a good refresher and update for the old html still stuck in the back of my mind.

I also downloaded the Developer Edition of Firefox to play around with. Now to go check out some of the sites I use frequently and see how they tick.

####The steps ahead

Next on the list is a quick project for myself: layout some game rules in the epub format. Since epub is all HTML and CSS (mostly), it will be a good place to put my new knowledge in to practice. I've downloaded Sigil, which will create the container files so I can concentrate on the content and layout. 

I can't tell if Sigil is epub 3 capable, though. That might require a bit of work to correct. 

Only one way to find out.
