####A quick note about updates

They will be happening later in the morning (MST) on Modays, instead of the usual 2am posts. My work schedule has (temporarily) shifted, so the post schedule will change accordingly.

####And now... progress?

[Yes, indeed!](files/LayoutXperiment.epub) It comes in the form of an epub file, based on an epub 3 template [provided by Markus Reiter](http://github.io/reitermarkus/epub3-boilerplate). I've only done a little messing about with fonts and content layout, but I also learned how to use the command line to build the epub using `zip -x` and `zip -rg`. If you have an epub compatible reader, give it a download and let me know what's broken (I only have my Kobo Aura and Android devices to test with).

More epub work on the way, including building one from scratch (just to try).
