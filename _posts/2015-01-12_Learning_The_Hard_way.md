title: Learning the hard way
---

So after a weekend's worth of work, I have installed Git, Jekyll, RemarkableApp, forked Jekyll Now, and am currently using github to edit and commit this post. In the next week I'll spend some time learning Git proper, so I know how to push up changes from my local machine without using GitHub.com. Also, I should spend a little time learning about Markdown, as I've never used it before. Baby steps, and all that.

Used the instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
