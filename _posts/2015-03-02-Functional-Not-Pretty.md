title: Functional, not Pretty

Not a great week. The last few days have been rough ones, motivationally (for pretty much anything). So not much to report.

####Except...

I found a way to force epubs to page break. The bad news is it requires individual xml files for each 'packet' of content. So I could use it to build a text-adventure / choose your own story, but a seperate file for each 'page' that has to be added to the epub manifest (manually)...

I really hope there's a way that's less work.
